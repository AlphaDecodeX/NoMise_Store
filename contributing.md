## How to Contribute

If you're new to open source or contributing to projects on GitHub, we recommend you check out the [GitHub Docs: Contributing to Open Source](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests) guide for a better understanding of the process.

Here are some ways you can contribute to the project:

- Reporting bugs or issues
- Requesting new features or enhancements
- Submitting pull requests for code changes or documentation improvements
- Providing feedback on existing issues and pull requests

## Code Contribution Guidelines

When making code contributions, please keep the following guidelines in mind:

1. Before starting to work on a new feature or bug fix, check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/AlphaDecodeX/NoMise_Store/issues) to see if the task is already in progress or has been reported. If not, create a new issue to discuss and get feedback from the maintainers.
2. Create a new branch for your contribution. Branch names should be descriptive and start with either `feature/` or `bugfix/`, followed by a short description of the change.
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
   ```
3. Follow the existing coding style and conventions used in the project.
4. Write clear and concise commit messages. Each commit should have a single, logical purpose.
5. Ensure that your code is properly tested, and existing tests pass successfully.
6. Document any new features or changes you introduce in the appropriate places (e.g., code comments, readme files).
7. Push your branch to your forked repository.
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/my-new-feature
   ```
8. When your contribution is ready, open a pull request (PR) against the `main`

branch of the main repository. Provide a clear title and description for your PR, explaining the changes made and the problem it solves. Reference any related issues or PRs, if applicable. 9. Engage in the conversation around your PR. Be responsive to feedback and make any requested changes. 10. Once the PR has been reviewed and approved, it will be merged into the main repository.

3. Mention the expected behavior and how the actual behavior differs.
4. Specify the version of the project and any other relevant software or hardware information.
5. Add appropriate labels to the issue, such as `bug` or `help wanted`.
